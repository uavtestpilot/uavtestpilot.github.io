<h5>Prototype Engineer
  Lab651 - Saint Paul, MN / 01/2017 - 01/2017
</h5>

Developed initial Oil Well Monitoring System for Oasis Petroleum. Created the System Context Diagram,
then breadboarded the required hardware to accomplish this: Used Particle's Electron microcontroller; 10
amp relays - to enable the fire extinguishers; infrared, temperature, and humidity sensors to determine if
there were operational problems -or a fire. Wrote the firmware to gather data (via I2C serial), determine
operational status, and report component values and system events to the web for the oil well operator to
act upon if need be. Oasis decided they needed to re-evaluate their spending priorities, and put this project
on hold for the time being.

Took an early retirement
Self Employed - Phoenix, AZ / 9/2003 - 12/2016

Left Honeywell in late 2003. Moved back to Minnesota to help out my mom in June of 2012. Have since
taken various college level courses (philosophy, religion, psychology, etc.). Taken the odd job, and
volunteered my time. Relevant engineering classes recently taken include C++14, the Lua programming
language using the Codea development environment for the iPad, and an on line Perl course. 

Senior Software Engineer promoted to Project Engineer 
Honeywell, Inc - Phoenix, AZ / 4/2000 - 9/2003

Designed, developed, and tested embedded Avionic Software and Systems using C/C++ for business and
commuter aircraft (Fokker, Gulf Stream, Embriar, Cessna). Wrote software tools using Perl for various
Engineering Teams as needed, and the technical user's guides for these software tools. Participated in the
Validation and Verification QA program for these aircraft.

Software Engineering Lead
American Express, Inc - contracting through PrismSoft, Phoenix, AZ / 8/1998 - 4/2000

Wrote web related middleware using C/C++ for American Express's Blue Card program rollout on the
web. Implemented an automated software development control system using RCS, make, and perl for the
Development Engineers. Wrote numerous software tools using Perl and Unix's Korn Shell for the
engineers responsible for American Express's web presence, and the technical user's guides for these
software tools. (PrismSoft is now Gate6, Inc.) 

Software Engineering Test Lead
Honeywell, Inc - contracting through Comforce, Phoenix, AZ / 8/1996 - 8/1998

Language for various aircraft programs. Wrote the technical user's guides for these software tools and
conducted the training classes for the software engineers using these tools.

Lead Engineer
AG Communication Systems - Phoenix, AZ / 5/1995 - 8/1996

Developed and tested communications software for the GTD-5 automated switching system using Forth.
Also wrote software tools using Perl for the Development and Test Teams for the GTD-5, and the
technical user's guides for these software tools. (AG Communication Systems is now Lucent
Technologies.)

Software Engineer
Honeywell, Inc - Phoenix, AZ / 8/1988 - 5/1995

the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the Boeing 777 aircraft. Participated in the Validation and
Verification QA program for these aircraft. Wrote an automated test regression tool using Perl, as well as
numerous other tools using Perl for the Test and Development engineering teams. Also wrote the technical
user's guides for these software tools. 

Engineering Internship
Honeywell, Inc - Phoenix, AZ / 6/1987 - 8/1987 

Was assigned the Intel 82786 Graphics Coprocessor to evaluate. Wrote a Primary Flight Display
simulation using C that made use of the 82786 Graphics Coprocessor's capabilities. Wrote a detailed
timing-analyses report on the different capabilities of the 82786 at the end of my internship and presented
it and the simulated PFD to management and the senior engineers.

Weather Specialist
United States Air Force - Phoenix, AZ / 07/1979 - 07/1983

Gathered meteorological data from satellites, weather balloons, military bases, and civilian reporting
stations, to prepare detailed weather maps and forecasts for pilots.
